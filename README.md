# New Portfolio
[This is my old Portfolio](https://stefanbemelmans.github.io/public/index.html) in case you want to see where I came from.

Revamping my web development portfolio
Inspired from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOlqX_772k) tutorial.
It was finally a layout I was happy with and it was nice to build out the CSS the tutorials way as I have
had limited experience with that particular method. I then came back and refactored with bootstrap and incorporated
 this cool [hover](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/) library. There are many things I would like to add, so we'll see how far I get.
